<bold> Welcome to Kitaake Rice Fast Neutron Mutant Population <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11203168/91338139-502ec680-e789-11ea-9257-180e219983c2.png" alt="KitBaseLogoNew1" width=100 height=100>

Whole-genome sequencing and cataloguing of mutations at a single nucleotide resolution provides a useful functional genomics resource for researchers. To this end, we generated a whole-genome sequenced fast-neutron-induced mutant population in the model rice cultivar KitaakeX, which completes its life cycle in 9 weeks. In collaboration with the Joint Genome Institute and Hudson Alpha, we sequenced 3,200 mutagenized lines (45-fold coverage). Detailed analysis of 1,504 mutant lines revealed 91,513 mutations affecting 32,307 genes (58% of all rice genes). Mutation types include single base substitutions, deletions, insertions, inversions, translocations, and tandem duplications. We observed a high proportion of loss-of-function mutations in the mutant collection. To facilitate public access to this genetic resource, we established this open access database, called Kitbase.
